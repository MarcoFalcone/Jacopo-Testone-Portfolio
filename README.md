# Jacopo Testone Portfolio

A Portfolio to showcase the work of the indipendent filmmaker and good friend of mine Jacopo Testone.

While looking online for the most popular framework out there I found React pretty much everywhere.(it's a library I know :})
It's a great tool and I'm in love with it. I wanted to explore the concept of a single page application as soon as possible so I built this brochure site for my mate using React's basic features:

- Stateful and Functional components;
- Props;
- JSX;

Libraries used:
- React Spring for animations;
- React i18Next for translations;


work by Marco Falcone

Note - Hooks added later on for extra functionalities.
